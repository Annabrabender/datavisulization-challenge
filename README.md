Analysis
In this initial analysis, Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most effective in having the smallest tumor volume at the last timepoint for the mice. This can be seen in the boxplot diagram off all four regimens. In a further investigation of Capomulin, when looking at the tumor volume of one mouse, we can see after 40 says the tumor shrunk significantly under the regimen.

There also appears to be a correlation between the weight of a mouse and the tumor volume under the Capomulin regimen. The correlation efficient was 0.84 which is considered to be a strong positive correlation.

The R-squared value on the regression analyis for Capomulin is 0.709, this value is the coefficient of determination and we can conclude around 70% of the model was fitting the data produced as it represents the variance and predicts the relationship between the variables. 70% is a high value. This particlaury supports the conclusion that Capomulin is effective in having the smallest tumor volume at the last timepoint for the mice.

It can also be noted that there was a close percentage of male and female mice in the study which can be seen on the pie charts, showing 51% male and 49% female.
